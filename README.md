# MERN Stack Learning

This repository contains my structured learning of the MERN stack
(JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React).

The code is based on guided tutorials (Coding Blocks) along with
my own notes, restructuring, and hands-on practice.

Each topic is organized in a lecture-wise and topic-based manner
to reflect consistent daily learning.
